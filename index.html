					To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
					But when I call you never seem to be home<br>
					Hello from the outside<br>
					At least I can say that I've tried<br>
					To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
					But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br>
